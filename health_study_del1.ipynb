    "**Descriptive statistics and visualisations**  \n",
    "Measures such as mean, median and standard deviation were calculated to summarise the main health variables. Histogram, boxplot and bar chart visualisations were used to explore distributions and group differences. This follows common practice in exploratory data analysis and helps check assumptions before applying formal statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulation of disease occurrence**  \n",
    "The observed disease proportion in the dataset was used to simulate new samples with NumPy’s `np.random.binomial`. This illustrates how random variation affects sample proportions and connects the empirical data to the binomial model (NumPy documentation: `numpy.random.binomial`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidence intervals (normal approximation and bootstrap)**  \n",
    "A 95% confidence interval for mean systolic blood pressure was first computed using the normal approximation: the sample mean plus or minus 1.96 times the standard error. This method is appropriate here because the sample is large and the distribution of systolic blood pressure is approximately symmetric (central limit theorem; standard statistics references).  \n",
    "To check robustness, a bootstrap confidence interval was also computed by repeatedly resampling the data. The bootstrap does not assume normality and is widely recommended for estimating uncertainty in sample estimates (Efron & Tibshirani, 1993).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis test (t-test)**  \n",
    "Differences in mean systolic blood pressure between smokers and non-smokers were tested using an independent two-sample t-test (Welch’s version) via `scipy.stats.ttest_ind`. This test is suitable for comparing means between two independent groups and is commonly used in similar health data analyses (SciPy documentation: `scipy.stats.ttest_ind`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Power simulation**  \n",
    "Power was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. Synthetic datasets were generated with NumPy’s `np.random.normal`, using the observed sample size and standard deviation. For each dataset, a t-test was applied, and the proportion of significant results was taken as the estimated power. This method is a practical way to assess how often a statistical test would detect an effect\n"
